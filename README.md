# Strong Dolphin Password Generator

## Description

**Strong Dolphin** - a good name for a password generator (thank you Alator). The string consisting of randomly thrown together characters (of the users choice) easily resembles the noise Dolphins make.

A strong password is required for almost all activities nowadays, but for it to be secure, we should not reuse them. Luckily, we now have password storage apps.

What password to choose... that is now the problem. Being put on the spot to think of *something new... again...* often results in ```TableDeskChair45```, and we're all fed up of that.  Plus we need our brain power for more important tasks.

A Password Generator, built focusing on the javascript skills I have learnt in week 3 of my coding bootcamp. 

>This week's Challenge requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.
